# Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

# Idea

1.Ice-Breaking Questions – Basic personal, professional, and general domain-related questions to make the candidate comfortable. Techno-Managerial Questions – Domain-specific technical questions (based on DRDO specialization) and management-based situational queries. Advanced Technical & Scenario-Based Questions – Deep technical problem-solving and case study analysis.

2.AI-Driven Question Generation Expert Panel Input + AI Suggestions Experts can input pre-defined question sets. AI can suggest questions based on the candidate’s resume and specialization. Dynamic Questioning AI adapts questions based on candidate responses in real time. Ensures deep probing of candidate’s technical expertise.

3.Candidate Response Evaluation AI-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine evaluates responses based on: Relevancy to the question. Accuracy & Depth of the answer. Communication Clarity & Confidence. Real-time scoring based on predefined scoring matrices.

4.Scoring & Assessment The system generates quantifiable scores for: Expert Questions (relevance to specialization). Candidate Responses (accuracy, depth, and relevancy). Overall Subject Knowledge Score. Weighted scoring ensures objective candidate ranking.

5.Expert Panel Assistance AI suggests follow-up questions based on candidate responses. Provides real-time analytics on candidate performance. Generates comparative analysis reports for multiple candidates.
6.Interview starts  with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions.

# Use Cases
1. Conducting Interviews for New Recruitment Candidate submits application  → Generates relevant questions → Candidate responds → AI evaluates responses → Experts verify and finalize scores.

2. Promotion Interviews for Existing Employees AI considers past performance data → Generates senior-level techno-managerial questions → Evaluates response depth and leadership skills → Generates report.

3.Expert Review & Score Adjustment Experts can override AI scores, add comments, and fine-tune evaluations based on subjective insights.

4.Data Analytics & Insights System provides analytics on candidate performance trends, and hiring success rates.
